# TripadviseTripavdise 

Trapadvise is a small Python program that helps travelers plan a trip, set a budget, and set a day-by-day spending plan. All the user will need to do is enter destinations, lodging, dates, flights/transportation, and any other activities they plan to do, along with their estimated costs. The end goal is for the program to total everything, warn the user if their plan exceeds the targeted amount, and save the trip as a file for later review. For the most part, I want the program to be simple but still practical. 
Who would use it?
Students, first-time travelers, and anyone who wants a quick, number-based plan before booking. This would also be useful for large groups, so information can be conveyed quickly. 
Why it’s useful 
Travel gets expensive fast, especially when you only think about the big costs and forget the small daily ones. A lot of people look at the flight and hotel price, but don’t add up food, transportation, shopping, and activities until it’s too late. Tripadvise helps break everything down before the trip starts. It shows the full cost and how much money you should plan to spend per day, so you’re not surprised later.
